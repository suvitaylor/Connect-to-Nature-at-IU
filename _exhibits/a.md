A main focus of this exhibition is to show students that there is nature all across campus. It was great to walk around Dunn Meadow and see everyone hammocking, having a picnic, play frisbee, etc. in early April. I chose that photo for this Exhibit because I think it sums up what it is like to be a college students enjoying a warm day. There is a sense of conntectness that students have after living on one campus for many years. Being in nature and warm weather seems to create an even larger sense of community.
